Trying something new, lets see how it goes

Hey everyone!
I'm Frederick Akili McDavid III, but you can just call me Freddy. I'm a senior (?) at BC, learning programming so I can translate my writing, and my friend's art into an interactive graphic novel styled comic. Its slow going as all I have committed are character bios along with their sketches, Principal photography for the created worlds architecture, and grand ideas slowly becoming things more tangible. Slowly but surely, I'm getting there! If you're interested let me know!
